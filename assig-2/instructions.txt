Assignment 2, CS747, Autumn 2016


In this assignment, you must implement a planning algorithm for
computing an optimal policy for a given MDP.


MDP FORMAT

The input to your planner will be an MDP, provided as a text file. The
format of the file will be as follows.

Number of states
Number of actions
Reward function
Transition function
Discount factor

The number of states S and the number of actions A will be integers
greater than 0 and less than 100. Assume that the states are numbered
0, 1, ..., S - 1, and the actions numbered 0, 1, ..., A - 1. The
reward function will be provided over SA lines, each line containing S
entries. Each entry corresponds to R(s, a, s'), wherein state s,
action a, and state s' are being iterated in sequence from 0 to S - 1,
0 to A - 1, and 0 to S - 1, respectively. A similar scheme is adopted
for the transition function T. Each reward will lie between -1 and 1
(both included). The discount factor is a real number between 0
(included) and 1 (exluded).

Below is a snippet of python code that is used to generate MDP files.
      
print S
print A

for s in range(0, S):
    for a in range(0, A):
        for sPrime in range(0, S):
            print str(R[s][a][sPrime]) + "\t",

        print "\n",

for s in range(0, S):
    for a in range(0, A):
        for sPrime in range(0, S):
            print str(T[s][a][sPrime]) + "\t",

        print "\n",

print gamma

In the data directory enclosed, you will find three sample MDP files.


OUTPUT

Given an MDP, your planner must compute the optimal value function V* and
an optimal policy pi*. Its output, written to standard output, must be
in the following format.

V*(0)	pi*(0)
V*(1)	pi*(1)
.
.
.
V*(S - 1)	pi*(S - 1)

In the data directory enclosed, you will find three output files
corresponging to the MDP files, which have solutions in the format
above.

Since your output will be checked automatically, make sure you have
nothing printed to stdout other than the S lines as above in
sequence. If the testing code is unable to parse your output, you will
not receive any marks.


SUBMISSION

You must submit a directory titled ``planner'', which contains all
your source and executable files. The directory must contain a script
titled planner.sh, which must take in exactly one command line
argument corresponding to an MDP. For testing your code, the following
command will be used from your planner directory.

./planner.sh mdpFileName

mdpFileName will include the full path. Before you submit, make sure
you can successfully run planner.sh on the departmental (sl2)
machines.

Include a file called notes.txt in your planner directory, that (1)
describes the algorithm your planner implements, and (2) provides
references to any libraries and code snippets you have utilised. It is
okay to use libraries for data structures and for operations such as
sorting. However, the logic used for planning must entirely be code
that you have written.

In summary: you must submit your planner directory (compressed as
planner.tar.gz) through Moodle. The directory must contain planner.sh,
along with all the sources and executables for the agent, as well as a
notes.txt file.


EVALUATION

Your planner will be tested on a large number of MDPs. Your task is to
ensure that it prints out the correct solution (V* and pi*) in each
case. Your marks on the assignment will be calculated by aggregating
the performance of your planner on different MDPs.

The instructor may look at your source code and notes to corroborate
the results obtained by your agent, and may also call you to a
face-to-face session to explain your code.


DEADLINE AND RULES

Your submission is due by 11.55 p.m., September 25, 2016.  You will
get a score of zero if your code is not received by the deadline.

You must work alone on this assignment. Do not share any code (whether
yours or code you have found on the Internet) with your classmates.

You will not be allowed to alter your code in any way after the
submission deadline. Before submission, make sure that it runs as
expected on the sl2 machines.
